# Foodtruck-Weather
First group project on Foodtrucks and Weather conditions in Boston.
2 APIs (foodtruck API and weather API) have been used.
CSS and Bootstrap have been used to create a polished UI/front-end.
The application displays different places in Boston, and once clicked, displays a list of foodtrucks near that location and its respective weather condition. 
Technologies used:
  HTML,
  CSS,
  Bootstrap,
  JavaScript,
  APIs and AJAX have been used as well
